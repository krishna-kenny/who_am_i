          <p>
            My name is Krishna Kenny, and I want to change the world. I want to
            become rich and famous and do all the awesome things that I see
            people doing on social media. I'm not looking for shortcuts; I'm
            looking for a challenge â€” something to burn through with the fire in
            me. I have a lot of energy, and it just needs direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't want a job. I don't want to be a software engineer or a web
            developer or whatever the names are. I want to solve a problem,
            whether that means coding an app, building a gadget, or selling
            shoes, for all I know. I'm tired of doing all the useless things
            school and college make you do, things that nobody in the real world
            cares about. I have learned a lot of things on the side of
            academics, and I want to put them to use. And, of course, all the
            useful stuff from academics as well.
          </p>

              Everyone has their part in the grand game of life. I am just
              trying to find mine and hopefully have some good times along the
              way.
